# js-bounty
For this bounty, I developed a simple banking website to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally blocks. The BankAccount class represents a bank account with properties like accountNumber, balance, and accountHolder. It has methods to deposit, withdraw, and checkBalance. The index.html file contains a form to interact with a BankAccount object. The app.js file handles the form submission using a switch statement to call the appropriate BankAccount method. Try-catch-finally blocks are used to gracefully handle errors like insufficient funds. Overall this project shows how to use OOP concepts like classes in JavaScript as well as control flow tools like switch and exception handling with try-catch-finally. The full code is available on GitHub and instructions on using the app are in the README. This project highlights core intermediate JavaScript skills.
